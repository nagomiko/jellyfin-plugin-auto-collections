A powerful Jellyfin plugin that automatically creates and maintains dynamic collections based on flexible criteria. This enhanced fork extends the original Smart Collections plugin with advanced boolean expression support and comprehensive filtering options.

## 🎯 Overview

The Auto Collections plugin enables you to create smart collections that automatically update as your library changes. Collections can be based on simple criteria or complex boolean expressions, allowing for highly specific and dynamic organization of your media library.
